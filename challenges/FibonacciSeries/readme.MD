### Challenge Details: FibonacciSeries

**Create a program that generates a Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.**

---

### More Details:

You have to make a program that gets a number as input from the user, representing how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence they want. The program should print the Fibonacci series starting from 0 and 1. The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.

---

### Example Output:

```
Enter the number: 5
0 1 1 2 3

Enter the number: 8
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
```

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is calculated by adding the two preceding terms.
