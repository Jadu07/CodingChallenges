# Challenge "GetTheSpeedToReach"

Write a program which gets the distance of the user's destination and the time in which the user wants to reach there.
The program will use Distance-Speed-Time formula to get the speed for reaching the destination in time.

Formula: `S = vt` 
where:
- S is the distance
- v is the Speed/Velocity
- t is the time

The program should have two modes for measurement:
- `m/s Meter per second` : Distance and Time will be taken in meters and seconds respectively.
- `km/h Kilometer per hour` : Distance and Time will be taken in kilo meters and hours respectively.

Adjust the formula yourself to get the required speed/velocity which is needed to cover the distance in given time.
