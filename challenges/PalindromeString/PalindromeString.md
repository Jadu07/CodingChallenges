# Challenge Details : PalindromeString
Create a program which checks if a given string is a Palindrome.

## More Details

You have to make a program which gets a string as an input from the user and then determines that it is a palindrome string or not. The program should return "**Palindrome**" if the string reads the same backward and forward, and "**Not Palindrome**" otherwise.
