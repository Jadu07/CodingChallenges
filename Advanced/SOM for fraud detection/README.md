# Credit Card Fraud Prediction using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Overview

This project implements a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) integrated with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the chances of credit card fraud. The model leverages unsupervised learning to cluster transaction data and supervised learning to classify potential fraudulent transactions.


## Features

- Clustering of credit card transactions using SOM.
- Fraud detection classification using ANN.
- Visualization of transaction clusters.
- High accuracy in predicting fraudulent transactions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Minisom
